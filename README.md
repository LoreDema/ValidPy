# ValidPy

This is a Python tool to choose the best configuration
and algorithm (between SVM and ANN) for your machine learning 
regression task.

It is been developed to take part to
[AA1 Cup 2014](http://www.di.unipi.it/~micheli/DID/CUP-AA1/2014/data2014.html).

It use the [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org/) implementation of ANN and 
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html) implementation
of SVM.

[Here](http://loredema.github.io/validpy/) you can find the documentation

## Quick start

This tool implement K-cross validation for both ANN and SVM.

For all the experiments you need a csv file comma "," 
separated. This file have to be 3 columns, each row is:

id, output_x, output_y

### ANN k-cross validation

To perform a k-cross validation over a file you need to
create a configuration JSON like this::

    {
      "grid":"true",
      "k":8,
      "parallel_process":4,
      "data_file":"absolute_path_to_data_file.csv",
      "out_folder":"absolute_path_output_folder",
      "input_length": 10,
      "output_length": 2,
      "hidden_layers":[1,2,3],
      "units":[15,25],
      "function":["sigmoid","gaussian"],
      "momentum":[0.0,0.9],
      "learning_rate":[0.01,0.05],
      "lr_decay":[1.0, 0.9999]
    }
    
Then you have to run ann_kcross.sh
in executable/ giving the
path to the configuration JSON as parameter::

    $ cd ./ValidPy/executable/
    $ sh ann_kcross.sh path_to_config_JSON
    
The script will produce a csv file containing for each
combination of the parameters the average training time and
the average average euclidean distance (computed on the validation
set outputs) over the k experiments.
It also produce for each combination a folder with the single
experiments details and models.

### SVM k-cross validation

To perform a k-cross validation over a file you need to
create a configuration JSON like this::

    {
      "grid":"true",
      "k":8,
      "parallel_process":4,
      "data_file":"absolute_path_to_data_file.csv",
      "out_folder":"absolute_path_output_folder",
      "input_length": 10,
      "output_length": 2,
      "kernel":["linear", "poly", "rbf", "sigmoid"],
      "C":[0.1, 1.0, 10, 100],
      "epsilon":[0.01,0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5],
      "degree":[3]
    }
    
Then you have to run svm_kcross.sh
in executable/ giving the
path to the configuration JSON as parameter::

    $ cd ./ValidPy/executable/
    $ sh svm_kcross.sh path_to_config_JSON
    
The script will produce a csv file containing for each
combination of the parameters the average training time and
the average average euclidean distance (computed on the validation
set outputs) over the k experiments.
It also produce for each combination a folder with the single
experiments details and models.

### ANN vs SVM k-cross validation

To perform a k-cross validation over a file you need to
create a configuration JSON like this, you can choose how
many time to repeat the experiment setting the experiments
parameter::

    {
      "experiments":4,
      "k":8,
      "parallel_process":4,
      "data_file":"absolute_path_to_data_file.csv",
      "out_folder":"absolute_path_output_folder",
      "input_length": 10,
      "output_length": 2,
      "ANN": {
        "hidden_layers":2,
        "units":25,
        "function":"sigmoid",
        "momentum":0.0,
        "learning_rate":0.05,
        "lr_decay":0.9999
      },
      "SVM": {
        "kernel":"rbf",
        "C":30,
        "epsilon":0.1,
        "degree":3
      }
    }
    
Then you have to run ann_vs_svm_kcross.sh
in executable/ giving the
path to the configuration JSON as parameter::

    $ cd ./ValidPy/executable/
    $ sh ann_vs_svm_kcross.sh path_to_config_JSON
    
The script will produce a csv file containing for each experiment
the average training time, the average average euclidean distance 
over the k experiments, the total average average training time 
and the total average average euclidean distance(computed on the 
validation set outputs).
It also produce for each experiment a folder with the single
experiment details and models.
    
### ANN test

To perform a test you need to
create a configuration JSON like this::

    {
      "training_set":"absolute_path_to_training_set_file.csv",
      "test_set":"absolute_path_to_test_set_file.csv"",
      "out_folder":"absolute_path_output_folder",
      "input_length": 10,
      "output_length": 2,
      "hidden_layers":2,
      "valid_prop":0.1,
      "units":25,
      "function":"sigmoid",
      "momentum":0.0,
      "learning_rate":0.05,
      "lr_decay":0.9999
    }

Then you have to run ann_test.sh
in executable/ giving the
path to the configuration JSON as parameter::

    $ cd ./ValidPy/executable/
    $ sh ann_test.sh path_to_config_JSON
    
The script will produce a txt file containing the 
training time and the average euclidean distance
over the test set outputs and the experiment models.

### SVM test

To perform a test you need to
create a configuration JSON like this::

    {
      "training_set":"absolute_path_to_training_set_file.csv",
      "test_set":"absolute_path_to_test_set_file.csv"",
      "out_folder":"absolute_path_output_folder",
      "input_length": 10,
      "output_length": 2,
      "kernel":"rbf",
      "C":30,
      "epsilon":0.1,
      "degree":3
    }

Then you have to run svm_test.sh
in executable/ giving the
path to the configuration JSON as parameter::

    $ cd ./ValidPy/executable/
    $ sh svm_test.sh path_to_config_JSON
    
The script will produce a txt file containing the 
training time and the average euclidean distance
over the test set outputs and the experiment models.

### SVM predict

To predict over a blind set you need a csv file comma "," 
separated. This file have to be 2 columns, each row is:

id, output_x

You have to create a configuration JSON like this::

    {
      "training_set":"absolute_path_to_training_set_file.csv",
      "test_set":"absolute_path_to_test_set_file.csv"",
      "out_folder":"absolute_path_output_folder",
      "out_file":"absolute_path_output_file.csv",
      "input_length": 10,
      "output_length": 2,
      "kernel":"rbf",
      "C":10,
      "epsilon":0.1,
      "degree":3
    }

Then you have to run svm_train.sh
in executable/ giving the
path to the configuration JSON as parameter::

    $ cd ./ValidPy/executable/
    $ sh svm_train.sh path_to_config_JSON
    
The script will produce for each output a model.

Then you have to run svm_predict.sh
in executable/ giving the
path to the configuration JSON as parameter::

    $ cd ./ValidPy/executable/
    $ sh svm_predict.sh path_to_config_JSON
    
The script will produce a csv file containing
3 columns, each row is:

id, output_x, output_y
